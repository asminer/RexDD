Working on split interface.

unpacked.h  :   interface for "unpacked" nodes

nodeman.h   :   efficient storage for large collections of nodes

unique.h    :   unique table for detecting duplicate nodes

============================================================

OLD STUFF:

forest.c  : forest settings, and forest functions.

rexdd.c   : preliminary edge functions, probably should
            become macros in rexdd.h
