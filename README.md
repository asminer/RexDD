# RexDD

Rule on Edge, Complemented, Swapped, Decision Diagram library

This is an open-source library for Binary Decision Diagrams
and variants. implemented in C.  
Long edges may be annotated with different reduction rules,
allowing for a single forest to contain BDDs, zero-suppressed BDDs,
and other reductions mixed together.  
Edges may be complemented to invert the output of a function, 
or swapped to invert the next variable.
